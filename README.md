# Engineering Week Challenge

Students will hack their names onto a list of "Famous Hackers"

# Setup

Requirements:
 - Apache2
 - PHP

Unpack this repository in your Apache folder (default: `/var/www/html`). PHP will need permission to read/write the leaderboard.txt file. You can do this with the following command:
```bash
sudo chmod o+w /var/www/html/leaderboard.txt
```
